**Why the random number?**
It started as a generic college assignment (Roll No: 10611). It was supposed to be a simple submission to get a grade. 

But I couldn't leave it alone. It evolved from "homework" into a personal engineering statement.

## The Philosophy: Return to Fundamentals

I look around the web and see static portfolios shipping with heavy frameworks and massive bundles just to render text on a screen. It felt wrong.

I wanted to strip away the bloat and focus on **Fundamentals**, not frameworks.

### Under the Hood
*   **Semantic HTML:** Structure over `<div>` soup. The code describes the content, making it readable for screen readers and search engines.
*   **Raw CSS:** Performance over libraries. No Tailwind, no Bootstrap. Just the cascade.
*   **Vanilla JS:** Used sparingly for the theme toggler and modal logic. No hydration steps, no build process.
*   **Universal Compatibility:** Because I stuck to standards, this site renders perfectly in a 4K browser and remains fully functional in text-only terminals like `lynx` or `termux`.

### The Result
A terminal-themed portfolio that actually respects the medium it simulates. It’s lightweight, accessible, and fast.
