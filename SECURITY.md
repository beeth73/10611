## Reporting a Vulnerability

As a Security Researcher, I welcome responsible disclosure. If you find a vulnerability in this portfolio (e.g., DOM-based XSS, Content Injection), please report it.

### How to Report
Please email me directly at **bhushanladgaonkar@gmail.com** with the subject line: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Portfolio`.

In your report, please include:
1.  Description of the vulnerability.
2.  Steps to reproduce (PoC).
3.  Impact analysis.

I will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.

### Scope & Rules of Engagement
**In Scope:**
*   Source code logic errors.
*   Client-side vulnerabilities (XSS, etc.) within my specific code.

**Out of Scope (Do Not Attempt):**
*   **DDoS or disruption of service** (This is hosted on GitHub; don't attack their infrastructure).
*   **Social Engineering** (Phishing, Spam).
*   **Physical Security** attacks.
*    vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Pages infrastructure itself (report those to GitHub).

### Safe Harbor
I pledge not to pursue legal action against researchers who:
*   Identify and report vulnerabilities in good faith.
*   Avoid exploiting the vulnerability to access data or harm the integrity of the site.
*   Give me a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before public disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep the ecosystem secure.
